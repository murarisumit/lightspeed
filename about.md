#### What is YinYang
[YinYang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang) is philosophy, that helped me grow myself and kept me sane. For what we take out of it is, there is nothing absolute right(which is relative too) or absolute wrong. There always something good/right in something which I don't like or adhere to and vice-versa.
